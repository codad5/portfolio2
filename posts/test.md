## Introduction

After much considerations i have decided to start blogging , i know it might be difficult (would be difficult), but i think i need to take this bold step
2
## Why i am doing this

I have been thinking about this for a while now, i have been thinking about how i can grow as a developer, and i think this is one of the ways i can do that. I have been thinking about how i can help others, and i think this is one of the ways i can do that. 

I also love teaching, and i think this is one of the ways i can do that. In the past few months i have been teaching myself how to code, and i have been teaching my friends how to code, and i end up repeating myself a lot teaching them the same things over and over again, so doing this would help me to teach them once and they can read it over and over again.

## What i am going to be blogging about
In general i love anything that has to do with science and technology **(i am an engineering student)**, so i am going to be blogging about anything that has to do with science and technology, but i am going to be focusing on programming, and i am going to be focusing on web development.

I would also be blogging about my journey as a developer, asoftware and tools i built, problems i face as a developer, and how i solve them, and also i would be blogging about my journey as a student, and how i am trying to balance school and work.



## What i am going to be using
This was a tough decision for me, thinking of what technologies i would use to build this blog, i have been thinking about using wordpress, or maybe build my own custom CMS (i know PHP and nodejs), but i ended up deciding to use Nextjs and Markdown, just because i wanted to learn Nextjs,  i love writing docs in markdown. *( that the way i learn new technologies)* and also to save time, cost in hosting and database management.

And by the way ** Markdown + [grey-matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter) + tailwind typography ** makes a pretty good combination for blogging.

so for this blog i used
- Nextjs (Reactjs)
- Markdown
- Tailwindcss (for styling) 
- Tailwindcss typography (for styling)
- Vercel (for hosting)
- Github (for version control)
for other npm packages i used, you can check the package.json file in the repo [here](https://github.com/codad5/portfolio2/blob/master/package.json)

You can clone and use this repo to build your own portfolio with a blog.
