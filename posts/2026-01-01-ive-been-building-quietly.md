I owe you an introduction.

More importantly, I owe *myself* one.

I've spent years learning, building, shipping, and quietly moving forward — while still feeling shy, sometimes inferior, and occasionally wondering if I belonged in the rooms I found myself in. This post is me correcting that. Not loudly. Not arrogantly. Just... honestly.

Let's do this properly.

## who i am

My name is **Chibueze Michael Aniezeofor**.  
Most people know me as **codad5**. Some call me **blue_bueze**.

I'm a software engineer. I also study Mechanical Engineering at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN).

I don't see these as conflicting paths. Engineering is engineering. I care less about titles and more about outcomes — *what gets built, how it's built, and why it matters*.

This is not a success story. It's a **still-building** one.

## where it started

My first real interaction with code was around 2017.

Back in secondary school, two friends and I were obsessed with ideas — hardware, software, games, cartoons, random things that would "make humans happier". We even formed a company in our heads. Still not launched. By God's grace, one day.

Reality hit hard though.

Hardware was expensive. Prototyping was expensive. Dreaming was free.

So I pivoted. If software was cheaper to build and could scale ideas faster, then I'd become *really* good at it.

Shoutout to Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates — teenage me genuinely believed I could do what they did. That delusion was necessary.

## learning with vibes and no resources

No stable internet.  
One desktop.  
My dad's laptop (that I later colonized permanently).

I touched Python. Installed Kodu Game Lab. Played with turtle graphics and pygame like I knew what I was doing.

I did not.

But I read anyway. I wanted to understand how computers worked physically — chips, hardware, signals — but I knew I had to start somewhere.

## lockdown changed my brain chemistry

Boarding school slowed things down for years. Then COVID lockdown happened.

HTML.  
CSS.  
JavaScript.

I learned mostly on my phone. When my phone spoiled, I used my mum's phone.

Day.  
Night.  
Repeat.

No Instagram. No TikTok. Just YouTube and curiosity.

This obsession cost me academically — my WAEC result could've been better. But at the time, my bigger fear was graduating broke and abandoning all those ideas.

Then my dad asked:

> "If I buy you one thing — laptop or phone?"

I didn't think.  
Laptop.

Two weeks later, I got my **first personal laptop** — with help from my uncle (forever grateful).

8GB RAM.  
500GB HDD.

That machine carried dreams.

## university reality check

Eight months later, UNN. Mechanical Engineering.

I chose it deliberately. I believed I could learn Computer Science online — but going the other way would be harder.

Here's the thing though:

I'm not good at being average.

I don't need to be first. But I can't be complacent. I care about *outcomes*, not titles. I love engineering because of what it lets me **build**.

## finding my people (harder than coding)

Making friends wasn't easy. I'm picky. I wanted vision and hunger.

Eventually, I met **Paul** — my first real friend in school. Solid guy. Bright mind. Disciplined.

Paul wanted to top the class.  
I wanted to become a cracked developer *and* survive school.

Our first tech money came from a ₦5,000 website gig.  
₦2,500 each.

Small money.  
Big validation.

## quiet but consistent growth

By early 2021, I moved from basic JavaScript and basic PHP to:

- PHP (OOP)
- TypeScript
- React
- Next.js
- Tailwind
- Rust (baby steps)

First interview.  
More gigs.

My first major role came from **Twitter** — literally from my replies. The internet is wild if you actually show up.

Big shoutout to **[Trulyao](https://trulyao.dev)** — genuinely incredible engineer and constant motivation.

## 2025 was proof

2025 was important.

I defended my B.Eng project.

I also worked as the **founding engineer at [AwaDoc](https://awadoc.com)**. 100k users in the first year. Fast delivery. Zero internal downtime.

That experience answered a question I had been asking myself for years:

> "Can I actually build serious systems?"

Yes. Apparently.

## what i'm building now

Some current projects:

- **[cilbup.site](https://cilbup.site)** — anonymous messages + tipping for creators
- **[resurgee.xyz](https://resurgee.xyz)** — an AI-powered calendar & task manager
- Supporting **[Sakura AI](https://x.com/agentsakura_ai)**
- Still deeply invested in **AwaDoc**

More coming. Quietly. Then loudly.

## gratitude (because nobody does this alone)

My parents.

Some of my aunts and uncles: **[Dr. Catherine](https://x.com/MakweCatherine)**, **[Aunt Jane](https://x.com/Janny4Real_0305)** (to name a few).

Some of my friends: **[Paul](https://x.com/ptbthefirst)**, **[Mike](https://x.com/Preacher__Mike)**, **[Sarah](https://x.com/justsa_rah)**, **[Peter](https://x.com/_simondevs)** (the dev), **Jerry**, **Michael Nuel** — and many more I can't fit here.

From **[AwaDoc](https://awadoc.com)**: **[Jesse](https://x.com/Jessseglee)**, **[Michael Tyler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-oyewusi-570736188)**, **[Michael Piper](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelpipergo/)**.

From **[Fusion Intel](https://fusionintel.io/)**: **[Kolade](https://www.instagram.com/adewoye.k.c/)**.

Bosses who became friends. Friends who became family.

Thank you.

## 2026 goals (written so I can't dodge them)

This year, I want to:

- Get **very good at chess** (not vibes-chess, real chess)
- Get **properly good at Rust**
- **Build and publish a mobile app**
- Improve leadership & management skills
- Communicate better (already seeing progress)
- Learn how to appreciate small wins instead of downplaying them
- Take more risks

## one last introduction

I'm **Chibueze Aniezeofor** — a software engineer who enjoys real problem-solving.

I don't limit myself to stacks or tools. I care about systems, scale, and impact — especially in this AI era.

I like:
- Gaming
- Coding
- Movies with actual stories
- Conversations that go somewhere

I dislike:
- Brain rot
- Noise without direction
- Being asked "what language do you code in?" as if that's the whole personality

I've been building quietly.

Not anymore.
