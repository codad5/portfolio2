## [When to upgrade your application](#when-to-upgrade-your-application)

You should upgrade if:

*   You're using Next.js 15.0.0 through 16.0.6: All Next.js applications running versions between 15.0.0 and 16.0.6 are affected by this vulnerability.
*   You're using Next.js 14 canary versions: If you're using Next.js 14 canaries after 14.3.0-canary.76, you are also vulnerable and need to downgrade or upgrade.
*   You're using React Server Components in any framework: This vulnerability affects React Server Components broadly. If you use RSC through Next.js or another framework, you need to update.

### [Recommendation](#recommendation)

For Next.js, upgrading to a [patched version](https://nextjs.org/blog/CVE-2025-66478) is strongly recommended and the only complete fix. All users of React Server Components, whether through Next.js or any other framework, should update immediately. Learn how to upgrade for [Next.js](#how-to-upgrade-for-next.js) and [other frameworks](#how-to-upgrade-for-other-frameworks).

## [Understanding React2Shell](#understanding-react2shell)

React2Shell is a critical vulnerability in React Server Components that affects React 19 and frameworks that use it. Under certain conditions, specially crafted requests could lead to unintended remote code execution.

### [Checking your vulnerability status](#checking-your-vulnerability-status)

The most reliable way to determine if you're vulnerable is to check your deployed version of React and Next.js. You need to verify the versions of:

*   `next`
*   `react-server-dom-webpack`
*   `react-server-dom-parcel`
*   `react-server-dom-turbopack`

If you're using Vercel, you will see a banner in the [vercel.com](http://vercel.com) dashboard when your production deployment is using a vulnerable version of these packages.​ This banner is an additional indication to review your deployment.

Everyone should also check their versions directly. This can be done automatically by using `npx fix-react2shell-next` (see instructions in [this section](#automatic-fix) of the bulletin).

### [Vercel WAF protection](#vercel-waf-protection)

Vercel WAF rules provide an additional layer of defense by filtering known exploit patterns:

*   [Prior to the CVE announcement](https://vercel.com/changelog/cve-2025-55182), Vercel worked with the React Team to design WAF rules to block exploitation and globally delivered protection to all Vercel users.
*   Ongoing monitoring for new exploit variants with iterative WAF rule updates (as of December 5, 2025, additional rules were deployed to cover newly identified attack patterns)

WAF rules cannot guarantee protection against all possible variants of an attack.

### [Vercel security actions dashboard](#vercel-security-actions-dashboard)

Vercel provides a unified dashboard that surfaces any security issues requiring action from your team, including remediation steps. View [your security actions dashboard](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Ffixes&title=View+Security+Actions+Dashboard).

### [Vercel deployment protection](#vercel-deployment-protection)

Even if your production app has been patched, older versions could still be vulnerable. We strongly recommend turning on [Standard Protection](https://vercel.com/docs/deployment-protection#standard-protection) for all deployments besides your production domain.

You can see a list of projects without deployment protection in your [security actions dashboard](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Ffixes&title=View+Security+Actions+Dashboard) or by reviewing [your deployment protection settings](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%2F%5Bproject%5D%2Fsettings%2Fdeployment-protection&title=Update%20deployment%20protection).

Make sure that preview deployments and deployments from other environments are not used by external users without protection bypass first (see the [documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/deployment-protection/methods-to-bypass-deployment-protection) for details).

You should also audit [shareable links](https://vercel.com/docs/deployment-protection/methods-to-bypass-deployment-protection/sharable-links) from your deployments. If you have disabled deployment protection to share domains that point to preview or custom environment deployments, you should implement [deployment protection exceptions](https://vercel.com/docs/deployment-protection/methods-to-bypass-deployment-protection/deployment-protection-exceptions) and make sure that all deployments added to the exception list have been patched.

### [Version upgrade methods](#version-upgrade-methods)

#### [Automated upgrade with Vercel Agent](#automated-upgrade-with-vercel-agent)

Vercel Agent can automatically detect vulnerable projects and open PRs that upgrade your code to patched versions.

View vulnerable projects and initiate upgrades [in the Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Ffixes&title=Fix+Vulnerable+Projects).

#### [Upgrade with the command line utility](#upgrade-with-the-command-line-utility)

You can quickly update your Next.js project to the right version by using the `fix-react2shell-next` npm package by running the following command in the root of your application:

terminal

```
1npx fix-react2shell-next
```

Once tested, deploy your updated application as soon as possible. See the [deployment guide](#deployment-guide) for instructions.

#### [Manual upgrade](#manual-upgrade)

1\. Identify your current version

Load a page from your app and run `next.version` in the browser console to see the current version or check your `package.json` to find your current Next.js version:

package.json

```
1{2  "dependencies": {3    "next": "15.3.4"4  }5}
```

2\. Update to the patched version

Based on the following list, identify which patched release you need to upgrade to:

| Vulnerable version | Patched release |
| --- | --- |
| Next.js 15.0.x | 15.0.5 |
| Next.js 15.1.x | 15.1.9 |
| Next.js 15.2.x | 15.2.6 |
| Next.js 15.3.x | 15.3.6 |
| Next.js 15.4.x | 15.4.8 |
| Next.js 15.5.x | 15.5.7 |
| Next.js 16.0.x | 16.0.10 |
| Next.js 14 canaries after 14.3.0-canary.76 | Downgrade to 14.3.0-canary.76 (not vulnerable) |
| Next.js 15 canaries before 15.6.0-canary.58 | 15.6.0-canary.58 |
| Next.js 16 canaries before 16.1.0-canary.12 | 16.1.0-canary.12 and after |

These patched versions include the hardened React Server Components implementation.

If you're currently using canary releases to enable PPR, you can update to 15.6.0-canary.58, which includes a fix for the vulnerability while continuing to support PPR. For other ways to patch older versions, see this [discussion post.](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/86813)

Update your `package.json`:

package.json

```
1{2  "dependencies": {3    "next": "15.3.6"4  }5}
```

3 . Install dependencies and update lockfile

_Always commit lockfile changes with together with_ `package.json` _changes._

Run your package manager's install command:

terminal

```
1# npm2npm install3
4# yarn5yarn install6
7# pnpm8pnpm install9
10# bun11bun install
```

4\. Deploy immediately

Once tested, deploy your updated application as soon as possible. See the [deployment guide](#deployment-guide) for instructions.

#### [Deployment guide](#deployment-guide)

Once tested, deploy your updated application as soon as possible.

If you're deploying to Vercel, the platform already blocks new deployments of vulnerable versions and has WAF rules in place, but upgrading remains critical.

If you deploy via Git, pushing your changes will trigger a preview build with the patched version, and merging will promote that build to production. You can also create a Manual Deployment from the Vercel Dashboard to publish the fix immediately.

If you are using the Vercel CLI, deploy with:

terminal

```
1vercel --prod
```

### [Rotating environment variables](#rotating-environment-variables)

Assume your vulnerable systems are potentially compromised. Once you have patched your framework version and re-deployed your application, we recommend rotating all your application secrets. Learn [how to rotate the environment variables](https://vercel.com/docs/environment-variables/rotating-secrets) for your Vercel team and projects.

## [How to upgrade other frameworks](#how-to-upgrade-other-frameworks)

If you use another framework that implements React Server Components, consult the [React Security Advisory](https://react.dev/blog/2025/12/03/critical-security-vulnerability-in-react-server-components) posted on the [react.dev blog](https://react.dev/blog). If you are running a vulnerable version of the affected software, you should update to a patched version immediately.

## [Next steps](#next-steps)

## [Frequently asked questions](#faq)

### What’s the easiest way to upgrade to a patched version?[](#what-s-the-easiest-way-to-upgrade-to-a-patched-version)

We’ve released an `npm` package to scan for vulnerable packages and upgrade them. You can read the full details on the [package page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fix-react2shell-next). Here’s an example run:

![terminal-light.png](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fhjgychtc108g%2F6IzqycSHTtmRobNfap82Xf%2F2d10ca5e04d3ede85b26ea8aa2e60f02%2Fterminal-light.png&w=1920&q=75)![terminal-light.png](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fhjgychtc108g%2F375agyuszDP8OHXz8xCdgi%2F306e94fc62e3aa5bd04f0cca91d5fc4b%2Fterminal-dark.png&w=1920&q=75)

### How do I know if I’m vulnerable to this CVE?[](#how-do-i-know-if-i-m-vulnerable-to-this-cve)

The most definitive way to understand your exposure is to check the version of React/Next that you have deployed against the CVE. See the [Checking your vulnerability status](#checking-your-vulnerability-status) above for information on how to check this.

We have enabled a banner on the [vercel.com](http://vercel.com) dashboard for our customers that informs you if the production deployment of a project contains a vulnerable version of `next`, `react-server-dom-webpack`, `react-server-dom-parcel`, or `react-server-dom-turbopack`.

Please consider this an extra layer of defense and not a replacement for checking if you are running vulnerable versions directly.

### How do I know if my app was exploited by CVE-2025-66478?[](#how-do-i-know-if-my-app-was-exploited-by-cve-2025-66478)

You cannot definitely tell but we recommend reviewing your application logs and activity for unexpected behavior. This could include unusual POST requests or spikes in function timeouts. However, function timeouts do not reliably indicate compromise because attackers can craft payloads that complete successfully, and timeouts could simply indicate scanning or probing activity rather than successful exploitation.

Vercel deployed WAF mitigations prior to the CVE announcement. As new exploit variants have emerged, we have identified and patched bypasses to our WAF rules. WAF rules are one layer of defense but can never guarantee 100% coverage. Upgrading to a patched version remains the only way to fully secure your application.

### What are the protections available to me?[](#what-are-the-protections-available-to-me)

Upgrading to a patched version is the only complete fix. Vercel WAF rules provide an additional layer of defense by filtering known exploit patterns, but WAF rules cannot guarantee protection against all possible variants of an attack.

You can ensure other deployments besides your production domain are protected by reviewing [your deployment protection settings](https://vercel.com/docs/deployment-protection#understanding-deployment-protection-by-environment).

We are closely monitoring for new exploit variants and iterating on our WAF rules as new information emerges. As of this morning, December 5, we’ve deployed additional rules to cover newly identified attack patterns. Our team will continue to add further layers of protections and share updates as they become available.

### What if I am using canary-only features in Next.js?[](#what-if-i-am-using-canary-only-features-in-next-js)

If you are currently using canary-only features in Next.js you should still prioritize updating to a patched version. See the [Required Action section](https://nextjs.org/blog/CVE-2025-66478#required-action) of the [Next.js Security Advisory](https://nextjs.org/blog/CVE-2025-66478) for instructions on how to update to a patched Next.js version without having to disable canary-only features.

### How can I test that the mitigations are working? Should I be using publicly available POCs to test if my application is secure?[](#how-can-i-test-that-the-mitigations-are-working-should-i-be-using-publicly-available-poc-s-to-test-if-my-application-is-secure)

We caution against using publicly available exploits against your production environment. Instead, we recommend following the above procedures to ensure all public deployments are using the latest versions of React Server Components and Next.js.

If you have a complex deployment that requires additional verification, we recommend testing in a sandboxed environment with synthetic data to avoid unintended consequences on your production services and data.

### Are v0 applications vulnerable?

Vercel is rolling out patches to existing v0 chats automatically over the next few days. However, you should patch affected v0 apps immediately rather than wait for the automatic update.

To patch a  manually:

1.  Open the deploy dialogue for your affected v0 chat
2.  Click the "Fix with v0" button

Note that v0 apps that are not published are unaffected by React2Shell.


# Security Bulletin: CVE-2025-55184 and CVE-2025-55183
Last updated December 12, 2025
By Security Team

---

Following the [React2Shell](https://vercel.com/kb/bulletin/react2shell) disclosure, increased community research into React Server Components surfaced two additional vulnerabilities that require patching: a high-severity Denial of Service ([CVE-2025-55184](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55184)) and a medium-severity Source Code Exposure ([CVE-2025-55183](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55183)). They affect React 19 and frameworks that use it, like Next.js.

Neither of these new issues allow for Remote Code Execution.

Critical CVEs often lead to follow ups. Once a patch lands, researchers dig deeper, looking for bypasses, variants, or missed edge cases. We are grateful to the security community for continuing to test and help strengthen the ecosystem.

We recommend checking this page and the [Vercel Developers X Account](https://x.com/vercel_dev) frequently for the latest updates, and will continue to include them in the Vercel Dashboard as well.

### [Required action](#required-action-)

These vulnerabilities affect React versions `19.0.0` through `19.2.1` and Next.js versions `13.x` through `16.x`.

If you're running an affected version, upgrade immediately, regardless of other protections in place.

Jump to the [How to upgrade and protect your Next.js app](#how-to-upgrade-and-protect-your-next.js-app) guide to learn how to patch and protect your application.

### [Updates](#updates)

| Date | Update |
| --- | --- |
| December 11, 4:31 PM PST | The initial fix was incomplete and did not fully prevent denial-of-service attacks for all payload types, resulting in [CVE-2025-67779](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67779). Everyone must upgrade to the latest patched versions listed in the [Patched versions table](#patched-versions). |

## [When to upgrade your application](#when-to-upgrade-your-application)

These vulnerabilities are present in React versions `19.0.0`, `19.0.1`, `19.1.0`, `19.1.1`, `19.1.2`, `19.2.0`, and `19.2.1` of the following packages:

*   `react-server-dom-parcel`
*   `react-server-dom-webpack`
*   `react-server-dom-turbopack`

These packages are included in the following frameworks and bundlers:

*   Next.js: `13.x`, `14.x`, `15.x`, and `16.x`
*   Other frameworks and plugins that embed or depend on React Server Components implementation (e.g., Vite, Parcel, React Router, RedwoodSDK, Waku)

## [Understanding CVE-2025-55184 and CVE-2025-55183](#understanding-cve-2025-55184-and-cve-2025-55183)

Denial of Service (CVE-2025-55184)

A malicious HTTP request can be crafted and sent to any App Router endpoint that, when deserialized, can cause the server process to hang and consume CPU.

Source Code Exposure (CVE-2025-55183)

A malicious HTTP request can be crafted and sent to any App Router endpoint that can return the compiled source code of Server Actions. This could reveal business logic, but would not expose secrets unless they were hardcoded directly into the Server Action’s code.

### [Vercel WAF protection](#vercel-waf-protection)

We created new rules to address these vulnerabilities and deployed them to the Vercel WAF to automatically protect all projects hosted on Vercel at no cost.

Vercel WAF rules provide an additional layer of defense by filtering known exploit patterns.

WAF rules cannot guarantee protection against all possible variants of an attack. Immediate upgrades to a patched version are required.

### [Vercel deployment protection](#vercel-deployment-protection)

Even if your production app has been patched, older versions could still be vulnerable. We strongly recommend turning on [Standard Protection](https://vercel.com/docs/deployment-protection#standard-protection) for all deployments besides your production domain.

You can see a list of projects without deployment protection in your [security actions dashboard](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Ffixes&title=View+Security+Actions+Dashboard) or by reviewing [your deployment protection settings](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%2F%5Bproject%5D%2Fsettings%2Fdeployment-protection&title=Update%20deployment%20protection).

Make sure that preview deployments and deployments from other environments are not used by external users without protection bypass first (see the [documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/deployment-protection/methods-to-bypass-deployment-protection) for details).

You should also audit [shareable links](https://vercel.com/docs/deployment-protection/methods-to-bypass-deployment-protection/sharable-links) from your deployments. If you have disabled deployment protection to share domains that point to preview or custom environment deployments, you should implement [deployment protection exceptions](https://vercel.com/docs/deployment-protection/methods-to-bypass-deployment-protection/deployment-protection-exceptions) and make sure that all deployments added to the exception list have been patched.

### [Version upgrade methods](#version-upgrade-methods)

#### [Automated upgrade with Vercel Agent](#automated-upgrade-with-vercel-agent)

Vercel Agent can automatically detect vulnerable projects and open PRs that upgrade your code to patched versions.

If you use another framework that implements React Server Components, consult the [upgrade instructions](https://react.dev/blog/2025/12/03/critical-security-vulnerability-in-react-server-components#update-instructions) from the React2Shell blog post on the [react.dev blog](https://react.dev/blog), which still apply.

For more information, read the new [React blog post](https://react.dev/blog/2025/12/11/denial-of-service-and-source-code-exposure-in-react-server-components) on the new vulnerabilities.

If you are running a vulnerable version of the affected software, you should update to a patched version immediately.
